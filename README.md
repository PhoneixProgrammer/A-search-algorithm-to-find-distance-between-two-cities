# A-search-algorithm-to-find-distance-between-two-cities
1. Using A*search algorithm, finding distance between desired france cities
2. Finding the shortest path between the cities with respect to the nodes 
3. Idea behind is to avoid expanding paths that are already expensive
4. Note: I have run this program in putty so its a zip file containing all files
